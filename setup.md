### Download PnET 
These directions are for the C++ Version of PnET-Daily. For more model choices, and more information go to the [PnET Website](http://www.pnet.sr.unh.edu/). 

1. Download the PnET repository by clicking the green `Clone or download` button on the PnET repo page. Similarly, you can fork this repository to your own GitHub page, and clone it to your local machine. 
2.  The downloaded zip will be called **PnET-master.zip**. Extract the contents in your location of choice on your computer.
### Install MinGW compiler
We need a compiler to convert *human-readable* source code into *computer-executable* machine code. For Windows, a common choice is a version of MinGW called **Mingw-w64**. 
1. Go to [SOURCEFORGE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/). Scroll down to **MinGW-W64 Online Installer** and download `MinGW-W64-install.exe`
2. Run the installation file. We can proceed with default settings. However, on the **Settings** page, under the **Architecture** drop down, we can select either *i686* or *x86-64*. If you have a 64-bit processor, you can select *x86-64*. If you miss this, it shouldn't matter, though.  Also, pay attention to where the files are installed -- likely program files.
3. Add MinGW `bin` to the PATH environment
   + Type `settings` into the Windows search bar
   + Search for `Edit environmental variables for your account`
   + Double-click `Path`
   + Click `New`, then `Browse...`, and navigate to where you downloaded MinGW. The path will depend on where you've put the files, but it will look something like: `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin`
    + Add this path, and click `OK`. 
4. Check MinGW installation
   + Type `Windows Powershell` into the Windows search bar. 
   + In the powershell, type:
    `g++ --version`
     and
    `gdb --version`.
    + For each of these, a disclaimer about the software should pop up. If this fails, doublecheck the environment path settings described in step 2. 
### Install and configure Visual Studio Code
VScode is a lightweight, opensource code editor that can be configured nicely to use for PnET development.
*Check out the [VScode setup tutoral](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) for more info.*
1. Download the [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installer, and install with the generic settings.
2. From the shell, navigate *into* the **Pnet-master** directory. Launch VScode by using the command `code .` 
3. Once VScode is running, search for and download the `C/C++ extension` from the Extension View (Ctrl+Shift+X). 
4. If you downloaded a different version of PnET from the website, skip ahead to the next step. If you have downloaded or cloned *this* PnET-Master Repo, you should see a folder called **.vscode**, which containts two .json files: `c_cpp_properties.json` and `tasks.json`. These should be *mostly* configured correctly, but you'll have to change a few pathways. In `c_cpp_properties.json`, change **compilerPath** to the location of g++.exe on your computer (See step 3 of [Install MinGW compiler](#install-mingw-compiler)). In `tasks.json`, change **"command":** and **"cwd":** the same way. Pay attention, **cwd** just points to \\bin and not to an executable. That should be it -- you should be able to skip ahead to [Compiling and executing](#compiling-and-executing).
5. If you've downloaded another version of PnET, you have to make the .json files. Open the `Command Palette` (Ctrl+Shift+P), and in the search bar, type *C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)* and click on it.
6. Scroll down to `Compiler path`, and where it says `specify a compiler path...` paste in the path to the g++.exe compiler. This is the same path we included for our environment (See step 3 of [Install MinGW compiler](#install-mingw-compiler)) plus `g++.exe`. Altogether, this will look something like `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin\g++.exe`
7. Scoll down to `IntelliSense mode` and set it to `gcc-x64`. All other settings should be fine. Now, on the left hand *Explorer*, there should be a folder called .vscode, and within it the *c_cpp_properties.json* file. This json file holds the configurations we just set, and we could edit this to make changes, too. 
8. Next, click the `Terminal` tab at the top of VScode. Click on `Configure Default Build Task...`
9. A drop-down should appear where you have the option to click on `shell: g++.exe build active file`. This will open a tasks.json file. If you do not have this option, go to step 13.
10. Confirm that `command` and `cwd` are pointing towards the compiler, paths we have previously set. They should look something like: <br/>
`"command": "C:\\Program Files\\mingw-w64\\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\\mingw64\\bin\\g++.exe"` <br/>
`"cwd": "C:\\Program Files\\mingw-w64\\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\\mingw64\\bin"`
11. Under `"Args:`, replace `${file}` with `${workspaceFolder}\\pnet_linux\\*.cpp` to tell vscode to build all .cpp files in the pnet_linux folder. [note to self: there must be a more generic way to include the pnet_linux in the workspace or paths.]
12. Also under `Args:`, modify the line that says `${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe` to say `${fileDirname}\\pnet_executable.exe` to compile the pnet_executable. You can name the executable whatever you want.
13. If under `Configure Default Build Task...` you are given the option to `Create a new tasks.json file from a template`, select this to open a tasks.json. In the pnet github repository there is a folder called `.vscode`. Copy the tasks.json file to replace the one in vscode. Change command and cwd to point towards your compiler (see step 10)

### Compiling and executing
Any time the PnET code or input files are change, we have to compile a new executable program. The section below will step through compiling from VScode or from the the shell.
1. In VScode, use the left-hand *Explorer* pannel to navigate into  ~/Pnet_linux and open **PnET_main.cpp**
2. click `Terminal`, and then click `Run Build Task...` Alternatively, just press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
3. To run the model, there are several options. In the shell navigate into the `~pnet-master/pnet_linux` folder and type the command, `./pnet_executable` to run the compiled model. Or, with old-fashioned mouse clicking, go to the `~pnet-master/pnet_linux`folder. You would see the `pnet_executable.exe` file. You can click on this to run the program. [Note to self: is there way to run the model GUI style from VScode? Some extension?]
4. Go look in `~/pnet-master/results/site`. You should see the generated output csv files.

##### A note on compiling from the shell
We could also easily compile from the shell:
1. Navigate into ~/pnet-master/pnet-linux.
2. Type `g++ -o pnet_executable *.cpp` and press enter. The \*.cpp indicates that the compiler should select *all* .cpp files in the directory. We could compile a single .cpp file just calling `g++ somefile.cpp`, but PnET is comprised of many .cpp files linked together, so they must be compiled together.
3. Run the exectuatable like described above: `./pnet_executable`



#### Shell Navigation Crashcourse
The shell allows us to access operating system services via command line tools. In Windows, we can use **PowerShell**. Another good option is [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Powershell can also be access from within VScode by clicking on the `Terminal` tab and then click `New terminal`. Here are some commands that are good to know: <br/>
`pwd` **print working directy** <br/>
`cd` **change directory** e.g.) `cd C:/Users/` will bring you from **C:/** to **C:/Users/** <br/>
`cd ..` **change directory to parent directory.** e.g.) from **C:/Users** to **C:/** <br/>
`ls` **list files** in the directory <br/>
`mkdir` **make new directory**
